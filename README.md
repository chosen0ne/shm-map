touchdb
=======

A key-value memory store. It used shared memory, so multiple processes can read while a process is writing to it. The performance of reading and writing is quite good, as all the operations are in the memory! So farï¼Œthe bindings of nodejs, python and lua have been developed. And the nginx C module 'ngx_touchdb' has also been developed, which can make nginx reads from touchdb.
